          <h2>Challenge Overview</h2>
          <p>Traditionally, a municipality’s citizens would report issues and complaints through a 311 phone system. However, today’s urban and suburban dweller – familiar with apps like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram – expects to engage online with their city. And they expect their online interactions to be seamless, easy to use, and fast. Plus municipalities need an app that will provide them with the information they need to investigate the issue.
          </p>

          <p>The app is designed for the citizens as end users. However, the buyers of the app are the municipalities themselves.

          <h2>Discovery: Research & Analysis</h2>
          <p>Having spent the last 2 and a half years in Product Management in the Code Enforcement and ePermitting space, I knew from past research what data municipalities needed from the app. To understand the end users’ needs – the citizens – I interviewed multiple urban and suburban dwellers in different cities across Canada.
          </p>

          <p>Key insights were around privacy and security. The app had to be easy and fast, but it also had to ensure that, when necessary, users needed to remain anonymous – both to the people they might be complaining about, and to the city itself.

          <h2>Design: Concepts & Sketching</h2>
          <p>Armed with the knowledge of what the city needed for its investigation, the design keyed on the end users’ needs – the people reporting those issues, and how they would provide that data to the city</p>

          <p>While the overarching concerns for safety and security informed features such as Save for Later and Anonymous Reporting, the design centered on the creation and delivery of the issue reports. Research also told us that the users most likely to report issues skewed older (35+) and, while they were relatively frequent users of social media, they were not digital natives. Additionally, users could be in their 50s and 60s, meaning that the design would have to be simple and intuitive.
          </p>

          <p>Because of this, we investigated the main apps the users were familiar with – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat – to determine best practices and implement a familiar approach.

          <h2>Develop: Prototyping</h2>
          <p>Based on the initial designs and the first round of user testing, theHi Fidelity Prototype was developed using Figma.

          <h2>Test: Validation, Usability, Feedback</h2>
          <p>User testing data was gathered through both moderated and unmoderated testing session using a combination of Lookback and Zoom. Key observations included:
          </p>

          <p>Nearly all users struggled with the first step of starting the report.
            Button for Selecting an Issue is not apparent enough in the layout.
            Despite the instructions, people were unsure which Issue Type to pick.
            While users were mostly successful with Submitting, 6 of them stated that they did not know if they had the required information to submit.
            2 of the older participants (60+) struggled the most.
            Tasks/Pages to focus on improving: Start Report, Select Issue Type, Add Description.

          <h2>Design: Iteration</h2>
          <p>Based on the user feedback and test session, the next iteration of the design focused on the main Report an Issue screen. This is the initial screen that users go to after logging in and the screen they come back to after completing each task in the report.
          </p>

          <p>The updates included:
            Display toast (popup) message when they first arrive on the screen providing initial instructions. This can be turned off for future visits.
            Large check marks that indicate which sections they’ve already completed.
            Red asterisks to indicate required sections.
            Removed the Save for Later task from the list of sections and made it a separate button to call it out better and separate from the rest of the tasks.

          <h2>Solution and Impact Overview</h2>
          <p>As a Product Manager, my main concern was ensuring that features matched the needs of the users. While usability was always a consideration, this project put that in the forefront and showed that equal measures need to be put into features and usability: a good product must be designed for success.
